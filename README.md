This paper presents a high-efficiency, CPU-only volumetric mapping framework based on a Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). The system incrementally fuses raw LiDAR point-cloud data into a voxel grid using a directional bitmask-based integration scheme, producing dense and consistent TSDF representations suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction. A key feature of the approach is that the processing time per point-cloud remains constant, regardless of the voxel grid resolution, enabling high resolution mapping without sacrificing runtime performance. In contrast to most recent TSDF/ESDF methods that rely on GPU acceleration, our method operates entirely on CPU, achieving competitive results in speed. Experiments on real-world open datasets demonstrate that the generated maps attain accuracy on par with contemporary mapping techniques.

## Overview

This framework incrementally fuses LiDAR data into a dense voxel grid:  
- **Directional kernels** model LiDAR beam geometry and occlusion.  
- **Bitmask encoding** ensures constant-time updates per scan.  
- **Signed distance representation** differentiates free and occupied space.  
- **Multi-threaded C++** implementation inside ROS 2.  

The design emphasizes predictable runtime, high resolution, and full CPU compatibility, making it suitable for robotic platforms where GPU resources are limited.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have ROS 2 Humble and Ubuntu 22.04 (or higher) installed on your system. These are the core requirements for the project to run smoothly. If you haven't installed ROS 2 Humble yet, follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for your platform. This guide will walk you through all the necessary steps to set up the core ROS 2 environment on your system.

## 2. Installation

### Install localy
To install and build the project, simply clone the repository as follows:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/DB-TSDF.git
   cd ..
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

### Install using Docker
Follow these steps to build and run DB-TSDF inside a Docker container:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/DB-TSDF.git
    cd DB-TSDF
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t db_tsdf_ros2:humble .
    ```

3. Allow Docker to access the X server (for GUI like RViz):
    ```bash
    xhost +local:docker
    ```

4. Run the container
    ```bash
    docker run -it \
      --env="DISPLAY" \
      --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
      --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
      --name db_tsdf_container \
      db_tsdf_ros2:humble
    ```
The Dockerfile sets up the entire environment and downloads the DB-TSDF code automatically.

## 3. Running the Code

The launch system uses a single main launch file (`db_tsdf_launch.py`) and a config argument to specify which dataset configuration to load.

This argument (e.g., `college`) will automatically load the corresponding parameter file (`college.yaml`) and the RViz configuration (`college.rviz`).

First, open a terminal, source your workspace, and run the launch file. The node will start, RViz will open, and the system will wait for data.

To launch using the college configuration:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch db_tsdf db_tsdf_launch.py config:=college
   ```


To feed data, simply play a recorded ROS 2 bag in another terminal:
   ```bash
   ros2 bag play /path/to/your_dataset
   ```

## 4. Output data and Services

The node provides ROS 2 services to export the reconstructed map:

- Mesh (STL)
   ```bash
   ros2 service call /save_grid_mesh std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"
   ```

- Voxel Point Cloud
   ```bash
   ros2 service call /save_grid_ply std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"   # grid_data.ply
   ros2 service call /save_grid_pcd std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"   # grid_data.pcd
   ```

- Voxel Statistics (CSV)
   ```bash
   ros2 service call /save_grid_csv std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"
    ```
